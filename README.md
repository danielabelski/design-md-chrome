# TypeUI DESIGN.md Extractor (Chrome Extension)

This Chrome extension extract styles and information from any given site and generates a `DESIGN.md` or `SKILL.md` file that you can use with tools such as Google Stitch, Claude Code, Codex, and others to build websites with a given design system blueprint. The file is based on the open-source [TypeUI DESIGN.md](https://www.typeui.sh/design-md) format.
